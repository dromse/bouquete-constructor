# bouquete-constructor
The Bouquet Constructor web application is designed to create a bouquet from any number of a wide range of offered flowers. If there is a mistake in choosing the composition of the bouquet or you just want to make changes, then it is possible to remove any of the flowers and choose a new one instead. In the basket you can see the price and composition of the bouquet. When ordering a bouquet, a notification is sent to the email you specified. Enjoy your use!
